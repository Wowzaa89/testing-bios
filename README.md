## Installation:
To install the bios with OpenOS, run this command (need an internet card):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wowzaa89/testing-bios/main/eeprom_code.lua /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && flash -q /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && reboot
```

# other things
- Also I'm not a very good at programming BIOS, so there will probably be some issues.<br>
